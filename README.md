# Arduino-Voice-Controlled-Car
In this project, We connect the Bluetooth module with the mobile application. Once it is connected, we give voice command through the mobile which are sent to the Arduino via the module. We accept the string and compare it to the commands. If it matches, its respective command gets executed. For example, when the string we receive is “right”, the bot turns right.
